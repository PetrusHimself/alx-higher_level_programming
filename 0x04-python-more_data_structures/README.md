0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
====================================================

Python

*   Weight: 1
*   Project over - took place from Dec 6, 2023 6:00 AM to Dec 7, 2023 6:00 AM
*   An auto review will be launched at the deadline

#### In a nutshell…

*   **Auto QA review:** 89.7/139 mandatory & 31.2/48 optional
*   **Altogether:**  **106.47%**
    *   Mandatory: 64.53%
    *   Optional: 65.0%
    *   Calculation:  64.53% + (64.53% \* 65.0%)  == **106.47%**
