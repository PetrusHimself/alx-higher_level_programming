========================================

Python

*   Weight: 1
*   Project over - took place from Nov 28, 2023 6:00 AM to Nov 29, 2023 6:00 AM
*   An auto review will be launched at the deadline

#### In a nutshell…

*   **Auto QA review:** 0.0/160 mandatory & 0.0/41 optional
*   **Altogether:**  **0.0%**
    *   Mandatory: 0.0%
    *   Optional: 0.0%
    *   Calculation:  0.0% + (0.0% \* 0.0%)  == **0.0%**
